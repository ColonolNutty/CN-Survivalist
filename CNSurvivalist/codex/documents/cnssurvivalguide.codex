	"Welcome to Durlock's Survivalist Mod 2.0!                                                          WILL YOU SURVIVE? ",
	
	"Here are some tips to help you out there:

> Monsters will see you before you see them, dig a trench asap.

> Placeable objects can't be picked up; once you place something, it's ^#aee1ee;PLACED^white;. Removing it with your pickaxe will break it for half their components. (same for ^orange;torches^white;)

> Water may wash over some crafting stations. Place them in a close, dry room if you don't want to lose them.",



"> If you are short on 'coal', try burning some wood in the Stone Furnace.

> If you need SP, try different tactics. Kill monsters, farm crops, break bonepiles, explore!

> Be careful about your health. Monsters, weather, even drowning could cost you. Make some Bandages, Survive!",



"> The only way to know what lies in a planet is by going down there yourself.

> But if you are not well equiped, you are not gonna get too far. 

> Make sure you have the right suit for the right planet.

> For edible meat and usable leather, a monster has to be killed with a bow!"
