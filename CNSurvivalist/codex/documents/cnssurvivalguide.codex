	"Here are some tips to help you out there:

> Monsters will see you before you see them, dig a trench asap.
> Placeable objects can't be picked up; once you place something, it's ^cyan;PLACED^reset;. Removing it with your pickaxe will break it for half their components. (same for ^orange;torches^reset;)
> Water may wash over some crafting stations. Place them in a closed, dry room if you don't want to lose them.",



"> If you are short on 'coal', try burning some wood in the Stone Furnace.
> If you need SP, try different tactics. Kill monsters, farm crops, break bonepiles, explore!
> Be careful about your health. Monsters, weather, even drowning could cost you. Make some Bandages, Survive!",



"> If you are not well equipped, you are not gonna get too far.
> Make sure you have the right suit for the right planet.
> For edible meat and usable leather, a monster has to be killed with a bow!"
